# THE-IOT-PROJECT

## THE PROBLEM
Development of IoT related projects generally face significant hurdles in understanding the IoT environment and working in tandem with devices and software.

## THE SOLUTION
"THE-IOT-PROJECT" is a lightweight, self-hostable platform inspired by Firebase. It is designed to provide developers with a suite of tools to simplify the process of building and managing Fullstack IoT applications. For the record, we would define a "Fullstack IoT application"  as a client application designed to manage, maintain and monitor the data sourced from IoT devices connected to the platform.

At its core, the platform provides basic device management tools that allow developers to, quickly and efficiently, connect their devices to the platform through the use of hardware libraries and auto-generated REST API(s) designed to ease the process.

In the future, we hope to provide users with Customizable Dashboards, auto-generated Graphql API(s) and integrations with commonly used platforms like Home Assistant, IFTTT and Grafana, to name a few.

## THE TIMELINE SO FAR
For the Hackathon, we chose to focus on the **Data Ingress side** of the platform for IoT devices and **Auto-generation of REST/Graphql API(s)** to allow users to quickly and easily access data. We had planned to developer what we call **Triggers**, user-defined functions that are executed during pre-defined events.

We have successfully built the core of the platform with data collection from IoT devices along with the auto-generation of the REST API.

Unfortunately, we could not develop the Dashboard, Graphql API(s) and Triggers done in time as a result of the aforementioned challenges above.  But this has proved the viability of the idea to ourselves and we are excited to see where this takes us.
