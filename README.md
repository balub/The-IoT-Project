# THE-IOT-PROJECT

## THE PROBLEM
Many developers, a large majority of those originating from the software domain, face significant hurdles in understanding the IoT environment and working in tandem with devices and software. The gap in their understanding proves to be quite a high wall and generally leads to several of them leaving their ideas half-finished or barely out of the ideation phase due to the signicant learning curve involved	

## THE SOLUTION
"THE-IOT-PROJECT" is a lightweight, self-hostable platform inspired by Firebase. It is designed to provide developers with a suite of tools to simplify the process of building and managing Fullstack IoT applications.

For the record, we would define a "Fullstack IoT application"  as an application, primarily focused on the client, designed to manage, maintain and monitor the data sourced from IoT devices connected to the platform.

At its core, we provide basic device management tools that allow developers to, quickly and efficiently, connect their devices to the platform through the use of hardware libraries and auto-generated API(s) designed to ease the process . This allows developers to quickly build their applications without worry for the underlying infrastructure.

In the future, we hope to provide users with Customisable Dashboards, auto-generated Graphql API(s) and integrations with commonly used platforms like Home Assistant, IFTTT and Grafana, to name a few. 

## THE HACKATHON TIMELINE SO FAR
For the Hackathon, we chose to focus on Data Ingress and Auto-generate of REST/Graphql API(s) to allow users to quickly and easily access data. We had planned to developer what we call "Triggers", functions that could be executed by the users during pre-defined events.

We have successfully built the core of the platform with Data Ingress along with the auto-generation of REST API(s). We had to overcome significant technical hurdles and our unfamiliarity with some of the techstack to reach our goals

Unfortunately, we could not develop the Dashboard, Graphql API(s) and Triggers done in time as a result of the aforementioned challenges above.  But this has proved the viability of the idea to ourselves and we are excited to see where this takes us.
